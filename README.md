## Features at a glance

- Non-destructive, node-based editing workflow.
- Batch processing.
- All image processing is done on the GPU.
- 32 bit (per channel), linear color pipeline.
- Support for the most common color spaces and file formats.
- You can write your own image processing effects using GLSL. A quick introduction on how to do that is [here](https://cascadedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writingshader.html).
- Or you can use existing [ISF shaders](https://cascadedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isfshaders.html) to add effects to your images.

## Tech

Cascade is written in C++ and runs on Windows and Linux. You will need a [Vulkan-compatible GPU](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/) to run the software.

The GUI was created in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and all rendering is done on the GPU through [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) with GLSL as shading language.

For IO and color space conversion we are using [OpenImageIO](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio)/[OpenColorIO](https://opencolorio.org/).

Multithreaded computations on the CPU are done with [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB).
